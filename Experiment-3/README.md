# Experiment-3: Implement Routing in Single Page Application (SPA)

## 🚀 Introduction

This experiment focuses on implementing client-side routing in a Single Page Application (SPA) using **React Router DOM v6**. It demonstrates how modern web applications achieve multi-page navigation without full page reloads, resulting in faster performance and a smoother user experience.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

After completing this experiment, you will be able to:

1. Understand the concept of client-side routing in Single Page Applications.  
2. Install and configure the React Router DOM library.  
3. Implement basic routing with multiple pages.  
4. Create dynamic routes using URL parameters.  
5. Design nested routes using layout components.  
6. Perform programmatic navigation using hooks.  
7. Implement protected routes with authentication logic.  
8. Handle invalid routes using a 404 Not Found page.  

## 🛠️ Description

In this experiment, you will:

- Compare client-side and server-side routing mechanisms.  
- Configure routing using `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, and `Route`.  
- Navigate between pages using `Link` and `NavLink`.  
- Implement dynamic routing with `useParams`.  
- Apply nested routing using `Outlet`.  
- Secure routes using authentication guards.  
- Handle unknown URLs gracefully using wildcard routes.
